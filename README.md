# Qliksense.Extension.amPieChart
Qliksense extension for amPieChart by amChart

## Introduction
While searching for some good charts, I found great charts @ [amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/).  You can use them for FREE with a watermark, but for a small purchase, the watermark can be removed legally.  

My first project was to create an extension for Qliksense amPieChart.  It has almost all of the functions that come with amChart Pie.  

You can find them here.  [AmPieChart] (https://docs.amcharts.com/3/javascriptcharts/AmPieChart)

This chart will also work with IE as well with Goggle Chrome.
